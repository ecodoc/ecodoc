- 👋 Hi, I’m @ecodoc
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css and javascript plus all that stuff it takes to make a website that they don't tell you about until you get stuck
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing because I am a loner
- 📫 How to reach me and I can't be reached
