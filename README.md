- 👋 Hi, I’m still @ecodoc
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development
- 🌱 I’m (currently) have been learning html, css for about 15 years now and still haven't learned much about javascript, plus all that stuff it takes to make a website that they don't tell you about until you get stuck
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing because I am a loner - I tried forums and Discord but they are all hard to read and had to find information because there is TMI and TME (too many emojis).
- 📫 How to reach me and I can't be reached - well, I guess I can be reached here, but I don't know how it works.
- Git is overwhelmingly too techincal for me, but I'll keep trying. Mostly I would like to know how to delete all changes and revert to the original copy, which I guess is the very first master branch?
